            <div class="story-content">
                <p class="story-intro">I have a very picky-with-food husband and a 3-year-old daughter with an ever-changing "I don't eat that" attitude. Together, they present the ultimate challenge for me—someone who always thought I simply didn't know how to cook. Yet one day, I realised that it wasn't the cooking process itself that was the blocker, but rather all the layers of annoyance surrounding it.</p>
                
                <div class="annoyance-level">
                    <h3 class="annoyance-title">Annoyance level 1 – recipe discovery</h3>
                    <p>If you cook the same "approved-by-family" meals over and over again, it quickly becomes boring. But if you want to try something new, you end up in a mess of searching for the right recipe—one that matches your cooking style and dietary requirements. And if you don't know exactly what you want to cook, you're completely helpless…</p>
                </div>

                <div class="annoyance-level">
                    <h3 class="annoyance-title">Annoyance level 2 – lost or hard-to-use recipes</h3>
                    <p>I often took screenshots of good-looking recipes on Instagram, only to be unable to find them when I actually wanted to try them. I saved reels of yummy recipes and then got annoyed that I had to rewatch them a million times while cooking. I asked friends and family for recipe recommendations, but the links they shared would always get lost in WhatsApp—or, if I was organised enough, buried in a note-taking app.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="annoyance-level">
                    <h3 class="annoyance-title">Annoyance level 3 – ads and all the blah-blah</h3>
                    <p>Once you open a recipe link, you don't just get the information you need to start cooking. No! First, you have to read about "the origins of avocados" and "what makes this recipe special." Then you scroll through a dozen ads, and only after that do you (maybe) find the ingredients list and instructions you actually needed.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="story-conclusion">I really, really wanted to cook interesting and tasty food for my family, so I had to remove the annoyances around recipe discovery, recipe keeping, and recipe reading—and this is how Look I Can Cook was born. Now, I'm genuinely thrilled every time I use this app, and here's why:</p>

                <ul class="story-benefits">
                    <li>All my favourite recipes are in one place, beautifully organised and presented in a single, easy-to-read format.</li>
                    <li>The app recommends recipes that perfectly match my requirements, so there's always something new to try.</li>
                    <li>If I find an interesting recipe anywhere—online, in print, or in handwritten cookbooks—or if someone shares one with me, I can add it to my Cookbook with just one click.</li>
                </ul>
